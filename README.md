# scRNA-seq analysis of erythroid precursors during human ontogenesis

Here, the integrated, single-cell transcriptomic studies of erythroid cells from the human yolk sac, fetal liver, preterm umbilical cord blood (PT-UCB), term UCB and adult bone marrow (BM) identified classical and immune subsets of erythroid precursors with divergent differentiation trajectories. 

R and Python script used to data analysis and figures.
